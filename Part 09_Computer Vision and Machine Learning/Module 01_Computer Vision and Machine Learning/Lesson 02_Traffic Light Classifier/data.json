Loading and visualizing the data**. \n      The first step in any classification task is to be familiar with your data; you'll need to load in the images of traffic lights and visualize them!\n\n**2. Pre-processing**. \n    The input images and output labels need to be standardized; that is, all the input should be of the same type of data and of the same size, and the output should be a numerical label. This way, you can analyze all the input images using the same procedures, and you know what output to expect when you eventually classify a new image.",
