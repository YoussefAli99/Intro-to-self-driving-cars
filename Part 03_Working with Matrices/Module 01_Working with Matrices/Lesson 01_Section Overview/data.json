In this course, you will gain your first exposure to many of the concepts and tools which you will keep coming back to as you make progress towards becoming a self-driving car engineer.\n\nAt the end of this course you will demonstrate your proficiency with basic linear algebra by writing a matrix `class` of your own and using this class to make a functioning \"Kalman Filter\" (which you'll learn all about shortly).\n\n## Lessons\n\n### 1. Introduction to Kalman Filters\nA Kalman Filter is an algorithm which uses noisy sensor measurements (and Bayes' Rule) to produce reliable estimates of unknown quantities (like where a vehicle is likely to be in 3 seconds). \n\nIn this lesson you'll learn the general intuition behind Kalman Filters.\n\n### 2. State and Object Oriented Programming\nWhat is the \"state\" of a self driving car? What quantities do we need to keep track of when programming a car to drive itself?\n\nIn this lesson you'll learn how roboticists think about \"state\" and how to use a programming tool called object oriented programming to manage that \"state\".\n\n### 3. Matrices and Transformations\nMatrix math is one of the most powerful mathematical tools that a self-driving car engineer can use. When a problem can be framed in the language of matrices, it's often possible to find programmatic solutions which are effective and very fast. \n\nThis lesson will give you a practical / non-theoretical approach to matrix math. \n",
